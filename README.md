# vip

The first iteration of our ‘vip’ compiler includes the scanner (tokens) and the parser with the grammar rules. We have also developed a diagram_converter that converts a flow diagram to a mid-stage code representation.

[Current] The second iteration includes the semantic cube and var and function tables generation. We also linked the generated code (from the diagram) to our syntax checking.
